### Hey! :rocket:

âœ¨ My name is Augusto Dias. I worked as a Software Engineer on Stilingue from 2018 until late 2020. I got experience with Java (JDK8+) and Spring Framework.

ðŸ”­ I like to use Go, Elixir and Haskell on some personal projects. 

ðŸŒ± I'm learning Rust and Scala right now.

You can talk to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/augustohdias) or [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/dias-augusto).
