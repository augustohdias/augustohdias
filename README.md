### Hey! :rocket:

âœ¨ My name is Augusto Dias. I worked as a Software Engineer on Stilingue from 2018 until late 2020, then in Elo7 from 2020 to early 2022, working mostly with Java, Scala, Spark, Akka, Spring and a whole lot of fun stuff ;)

ðŸ”­ I like to use Go, Elixir, Rust and Haskell on some personal projects.
