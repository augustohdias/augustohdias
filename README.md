### Hey! :rocket:

âœ¨ My name is Augusto Dias. I worked as a Software Engineer on Stilingue from 2018 until late 2020, then in Elo7 from 2020 to early 2022, working mostly with Java, Scala, Spark, Akka, Spring and a whole lot of fun stuff. Now, I'm building medical systems with cool people at Pixeon ;)

ðŸ”­ I like to use Go, Elixir and Haskell on some personal projects. 

ðŸŒ± I'm learning Rust and Scala right now.

You can talk to me on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/dias-augusto).
