### Hey! :rocket:

âœ¨ My name is Augusto Dias. I worked as a Software Engineer on Stilingue from 2018 until late 2020, working mostly with Java and Spring Framework. Now, I'm working (and learning) at Elo7 with a lot of Scala, Spark and other fun stuff.

ðŸ”­ I like to use Go, Elixir and Haskell on some personal projects. 

ðŸŒ± I'm learning Rust and Scala right now.

You can talk to me on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/dias-augusto).
